Q: Change your exception to a RuntimeException and see that you no longer need the throws clause. 
Can you relate this to checked/unchecked exceptions? Nothing to submit.

When we change it from a runtime exception we do not need a throws clause so we don't need to check
it. This means that it is an unchecked exception.


Just run the files as normal; main is in ATM. Thanks!
